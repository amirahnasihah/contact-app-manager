# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Different branches to show different pattern.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Styling - Semantic UI React

UI Library used in this app: [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/). The official Semantic-UI-React integration.

## App.js  

- The import statement for ConfirmDeletePage is commented out, which means that it will not be used in the code.
- The code uses the ?? operator, which is a nullish coalescing operator introduced in JavaScript version ECMAScript 2020. This operator is not supported in older versions of JavaScript.
- The code uses the useEffect hook, which is a function that is called after a component is rendered in a React application. This hook is used to perform side effects, such as setting the value of LOCALS_STORAGE_KEY in local storage.
- The addContactHandler function is used to add a new contact to the contacts state. This function is passed to the AddContact component as a prop, and is called when the user submits the form to add a new contact.
- The removeContactHandler function is used to remove a contact from the contacts state. This function is passed to the ContactList component as a prop, and is called when the user clicks on a button to delete a contact.
- The render prop is used in the Route components to render the components that are rendered when the user navigates to a specific route. For example, when the user navigates to the /add route, the AddContact component is rendered.
